1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when there are other people working on the same project and willing to contribute their changes to my current project

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
changes in remote repository on GitHub could be made by other people. I would like to examine the file before its pulled on the local repository
