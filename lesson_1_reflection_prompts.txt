How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
using the FC command in command prompt helped me

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
it will help me go to previous versions easily and check for differences between files

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros - you can decide on the content that goes in each commit , number of files saved are limited
cons - if forget to save the data might be lost

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is targetting saving a code and usually a code to a project involves multiple files - hence Git saves multiple files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log --> list of commits along with the timestamp
git diff --> difference between contents of the files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
it helps you go back to the older versions , compare , find the difference and correct the bug if needed
